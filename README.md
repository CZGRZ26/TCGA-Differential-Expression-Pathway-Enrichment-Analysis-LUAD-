# TCGA-Differential-Expression-Pathway-Enrichment-Analysis-LUAD-
This project performs a complete RNA-seq analysis pipeline for TCGA-LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma) using R. It includes data preprocessing, quality control, differential expression (DE) analysis, visualization, and pathway enrichment to identify biologically meaningful gene expression changes between tumor and normal tissues.
